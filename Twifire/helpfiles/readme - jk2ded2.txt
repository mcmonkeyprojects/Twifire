One important hack - Q3InfoBoom - operates entirely out of the scope of the vm
Which means Twifire cannot counter it.
To protect your server, I give you jk2ded2.exe - a modified version of jk2ded that can resist Q3InfoBoom.
Simply use it exactly how you would jkded.exe.
To use it, you must copy it into your JK2/GameData folder.

-- Note: Also included is JK2mp2, which accomplishes the same thing.



///// NOTE: IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU USE JK2:SE INSTEAD OF THIS
